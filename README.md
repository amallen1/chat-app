# Chat Application - Chat.io

This project is a real time chat application built with React and styled components that uses the ChatEngine API for its chat services. User authentication is handled with Firebase so that users can create an account with email/password or sign in with Google to use the application.

In order to communicate with one another multiple accounts have to be made on the app and once inside, users can create a chat and add the emails of other accounts registered with the app.
